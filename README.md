**Stage #1 Let there be light**  
Create something out of nothing: generate a starting combination and specify the field. 

**Stage #2 Generations**  
Using classes and arrays, enable the player to enter the number of generations and see what the outcome is.

**Stage #3 Life goes by**  
Make your game truly entertaining by letting the player observe your universe live and evolve. 

**Stage #4 Looking good!**  
Practice using Swing and multithreading: create a nice interface for your game of life.

Almost done! Add some extra functions (pausing and unpausing, speed regulation) to make your game more engaging and various.
